# INTRODUCTION
Below you can find three basic classifications of patterns: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral.

# TYPES OF DESIGN PATTERN
There are three basic kinds of design patterns:
* _Structural_: Generally deal with relationships between entities, making it easier for these entities to work together.
* _Behavioral_: Are used in communications between entities and make it easier and more flexible for these entities to communicate.
* _Creational_: Provide instantiation mechanisms, making it easier to create objects in a way that suits the situation.

## 1. Structural Patterns
* _Adapter_: Match interfaces of different classes.
* _Bridge_: Separate an objectâ€™s abstraction from its implementation.
* _Composite_: A tree structure of simple and composite objects.
* _Decorator_: Add responsibilities to objects dynamically.
* _Facade_: A single class that represents an entire subsystem.
* _Flyweight_: A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing.
* _Proxy_: An object representing another object.

## 2. Behavioral Patterns
* _Chain of Responsibility_: A way of passing a request between a chain of objects.
* _Iterator_: Sequentially access the elements of a collection.
* _Mediator_: Define simplified communication between classes.
* _Memento_: Capture and restores an object's internal state.
* _Observer_: A way of notifying change to a number of classes.
* _State_: Alter an object's behavior when its state changes.
* _Strategy_: Encapsulate an algorithm inside a class.
* _Template Method_: Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass.
* _Visitor_: Define a new operation to a class without change.

## 3.Creational Patterns

* _Abstract Factory_: Create an instance of several families of classes.
* _Builder_: Separate object construction from its representation.
* _Factory Method_: Create an instance of several derived classes.
* _Prototype_: A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned.
* _Singleton_: A class in which only a single instance can exist.

### 1.1 ADAPTER PATTERN
The Adapter pattern is used to convert the programming interface of one class into that of another. We use
adapters whenever we want unrelated classes to work together in a single program. The concept of an adapter is
thus pretty simple: We write a class that has the desired interface and then make it communicate with the class
that has a different interface.

* Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
* Adapter lets classes work together, that could not otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

**Example**:

In this example, we want to build functionality for Remote desktop connection.
`IMyRemoteDesktop` interface tells the functionality which i need to accomplish in remote connection.

So, `MyRemoteDesktopWrapper` class was extended from `IMyRemoteDesktop` interface and written with the logic for remote connection. At the same time, we want to use Real VNC API to write another logic to connect to remote desktop.

So, using adapter pattern, `IMyRemoteDesktop` was extended to `RealVNCRemoteDesktopAdapter` and fit the Real VNC functionality to make it to work together.

### 1.2 BRIDGE PATTERN
-------------------
At first sight, the _Bridge_ pattern looks a lot like the _Adapter_ pattern in that a class is used to convert one kind of interface to another. However, the intent of the Adapter pattern is to make one or more classes' interfaces look the same as that of a particular class. The Bridge pattern is designed to separate a class's interface from its implementation so you can vary or replace the implementation without changing the client code.

* The intent of this pattern is to decouple abstraction from implementation so that the two can vary independently.

**Example**:

In this example, We want to build Remote Control functionality for Televisions.

The functionality for remote controller is same for any brand or model of television.
`RemoteControl` abstract class was build that accepts television object using `SetTelevision()`.
`RemoteController` class extends from `RemoteControl` class acts accordingly for On/Off/Change channel for any kind of television that extended from ITelevision.

### 1.3 COMPOSITE PATTERN
A component in object orientation may be either an individual object or a collection of objects.
The _Composite_ pattern is designed to accommodate both cases. You can use the Composite
to build part-whole hierarchies or to construct data representations of trees. In summary, a composite is a collection of objects, any one of which may be either a composite or just a primitive object. In tree nomenclature, some objects may be nodes with additional branches and some may be leaves.

* The intent of this pattern is to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
* Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

**Example**:

In this example, `IEmployee` interface is extended to `Branch` or `Leaf` class.

Where as `Branch` is composite of objects that holds subordinates and `Leaf` are primitive object that has no subordinates.
But, both `Branch` and `Leaf` class are treated uniformly.

### 1.4 DECORATOR PATTERN
The _Decorator_ pattern provides us with a way to modify the behavior of individual objects without having to create a new derived class. Suppose we have a program that uses eight objects, but three of them need an additional feature. You could create a derived class for each of these objects, and in many cases this would be a perfectly acceptable solution. However, if each of these three objects requires different features, this would mean creating three derived classes. Further, if one of the classes has features of both of the other classes, you begin to create complexity that is both confusing and unnecessary.

* The intent of this pattern is to add additional responsibilities dynamically to an object.

**Example**:

In this example, "Pizza" class tells basic cost and description of Pizza. `PizzaToppings` is a decorator class that add responsibility by extending to other class like `ExtraCheese`, `ExtraSoya` to append description and cost.

### 1.5 FACADE PATTERN
-------------------
The _Facade_ pattern is used to wrap a set of complex classes into a simpler enclosing interface. As your programs evolve and develop, they grow in complexity. In fact, for all the excitement about using design patterns, these patterns sometimes generate so many classes that it is difficult to understand the program's flow. Furthermore, there may be a number of complicated subsystems, each of which has its own complex interface.

* Simplify the complexity by providing a simplified interface to these subsystems

**Example**:

In this example, to order a product few sub-systems involved in it like choosing a product, payment gateway and invoice.

All the sub-systems are available by `OrderFacade` class that contains `PlaceOrder()` method.

### 1.6 FLY-WEIGHT PATTERN
The _Flyweight_ pattern is used to avoid the overhead of large numbers of very similar classes. There are cases in programming where it seems that you need to generate a very large number of small class instances to represent data. Sometimes you can greatly reduce the number of different classes that you need to instantiate if you can recognize that the instances are fundamentally the same except for a few parameters. If you can move those variables outside the class instance and pass them in as part of a method call, the number of separate instances can be greatly reduced by sharing them.

* The intent of this pattern is to use sharing to support a large number of objects that have part of their internal state in common where the other part of state can vary.

**Example**:

In this example, to print the business card for an organization, Address is common for all employees.

The things going to change is Name, Designation, Department, etc. So, Address object holds as a static property that used for all employees business cards to reduce the weight of business card object.

### 1.7 PROXY PATTERN
------------------
The _Proxy_ pattern is used when you need to represent an object that is complex or time consuming to create with a simpler one. If creating an object is expensive in time or computer resources, Proxy allows you to postpone this creation until you need the actual object. A _Proxy_ usually has the same methods as the object it represents, and once the object is loaded, it passes on the method calls from the Proxy to the actual object.

* The intent of this pattern is to provide a placeholder for an object to control references to it.

**Example**:

In this example, to make a payment, payment can be of any form like Cheque leaf or Online transfer.

Both `CheckProxy` and `OnlineFundTransfer` extended from `IPayment` interface to make the payment.

### 2.1 CHAIN-OF-RESPONSIBILITY PATTERN
The _Chain of Responsibility_ pattern allows a number of classes to attempt to handle a request without any of them knowing about the capabilities of the other classes. It provides a loose coupling between these classes; the only common link is the request that is passed between them. The request is passed along until one of the classes can handle it.

* It avoids attaching the sender of a request to its receiver, giving this way other objects the possibility of handling the request too.
* The objects become parts of a chain and the request is sent from one object to another across the chain until one of the objects will handle it.

**Example**:

In this example, if an employee wants to submit Reimbursement for official expenses. He will be submitting to his manager.

Depends on amount spent, either manager can approve it or it will be escalated to _Senior Manager_ or it will again escalate to _Director_ if amount is too high. Here, object gets changed depends on escalation level.

### 2.2 ITERATOR PATTERN
The _Iterator_ is one of the simplest and most frequently used of the design patterns. The Iterator pattern allows
you to move through a list or collection of data using a standard interface without having to know the details of
the internal representations of that data. In addition, you can also define special iterators that perform some
special processing and return only specified elements of the data collection.

* Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

**Example**:

In this example, Instead of creating array of objects and managing array in client program, a collection class that extended from
`IEnumerable<T>` (where `T` is an scalar object). `MedicalEquipment` is a scalar class for which `MedicalEquipmentCollection` collection class was created to manage collection of Medical Equipments in a hospital.

### 2.3 MEDIATOR PATTERN
When a program is made up of a number of classes, the logic and computation is divided logically among these classes. However, as more of these isolated classes are developed in a program, the problem of communication between these classes becomes more complex. The more each class needs to know about the methods of another class, the more tangled the class structure can become. This makes the program harder to read and harder to maintain. Further, it can become difficult to change the program, since any change may affect code in several other classes. The Mediator pattern addresses this problem by promoting looser coupling between these classes. Mediators accomplish this by being the only class that has detailed knowledge of the methods of other classes. Classes inform the _Mediator_ when changes occur, and the Mediator passes on the changes to any other classes that need to be informed.

* Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. _Mediator_ promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently.

**Example**:

In this example, different objects of `ChatPerson` class interchange information between itself using `Messenger` class.

`Messenger` class that extended from `IMessenger` interface facilitates/mediates communication between two different "ChatPerson" objects.

### 2.5 MEMENTO PATTERN
Ideally, it should be possible to save and restore this state without making each object take care of this task and without violating encapsulation. It is sometimes necessary to capture the internal state of an object at some point and have the ability to restore the object to that state later in time. Such a case is useful in case of error or failure in serial transaction scope.

* The intent of this pattern is to capture the internal state of an object without violating encapsulation and thus providing a mean for restoring the object into initial state when needed.

**Example**:

Calculator has option to memorize the value and retrieve value from memory. In this example, `SimpleCalculator` class extended from `ICalc` interface do some maths operation.

`ResultsCache` used to cache the result and hold it in memory and client program can retrieve value that cached any time for further calculation.


### 2.6 OBSERVER PATTERN
All object oriented programming is about objects and their interaction. The cases when certain objects need to be informed about the changes occurred in other objects are frequent. To have a good design means to decouple as much as possible and to reduce the dependencies. The Observer Design Pattern can be used whenever a subject has to be observed by one or more observers.

* Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

**Example**:

In this example, there is `Stock` class extended from `IStock` interface and `Investor` class extended from `IInvestor`.

`Investor` will be subscribed to `Stock` object. if any change in price of `Stock` object, all "Investor" subscribed will get notification on price update.

### 2.7 STATE PATTERN
The _State_ pattern is used when you want to have an object represent the state of your application and switch application states by switching objects. For example, you could have an enclosing class switch between a number of related contained classes and pass method calls on to the current contained class. Design patterns suggest that the _State_ pattern switches between internal classes in such a way that the enclosing object appears to change its class.

**Example**:

In this example, `Account` class has the `State` as property. `State` object changed according to withdrawable balance.

Once account created newly, it will be `Bronze` state. Its `Balance` is beyond 50K, `State` property change to `Silver` state.

### 2.8 STRATEGY PATTERN
The _Strategy_ pattern is much like the State pattern in outline but a little different in intent. The _Strategy_ pattern consists of a number of related algorithms encapsulated in a driver class called the Context. Your client program can select one of these differing algorithms, or in some cases, the Context might select the best one for you. The intent is to make these algorithms interchangeable and provide a way to choose the most appropriate one. The difference between State and Strategy is that the user generally chooses which of several strategies to apply and that only one strategy at a time is likely to be instantiated and active within the Context class.

* Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

**Example**:

In this example, we have to design a `Vehicle`. Only Logic that changes is Engine Algorithm. It can Run, Float or Fly. 

Depends on vehicle type, logic will get changed. For Car, we will apply `RunningLogic`, for Boat, we will apply `FloatingLogic`, etc. Logic will get change according to the Vehicle type.

### 2.9 TEMPLATE-METHOD PATTERN
The _Template Method_ pattern is a very simple pattern that you will find yourself using frequently. Whenever you write a parent class where you leave one or more of the methods to be implemented by derived classes, you are in essence using the Template pattern. The Template pattern formalizes the idea of defining an algorithm in a class but differing some of the logic to be implemented in subclasses.

* Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses.
* Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without letting them to change the algorithm's structure.

**Example**:

In this example, `EncryptionAlgorithm` class will give a method `EncryptText()` to encrypt text message but not tells anything about encryption. `EncryptionAlgorithm` is extended to `TripleDESEncryption` and `RSAEncryption` to apply Triple-DES and RSA encryption technique respectively. Here, base class declares but derived classes defined the method logic.

### 2.10 VISITOR PATTERN
Collections are data types widely used in object oriented programming. Often collections contain objects of different 
types and in those cases some operations have to be performed on all the collection elements without knowing the type.

* Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure.
* _Visitor_ lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.

**Example**:

In this example, There is `Employee`, `Address` and `Contact` class. We want to write values of the property to either Text or XML format.

`IVisitor` is an interface extended to `TextVisitor` and `XmlVisitor` to write in Text and XML format.

### 3.1 ABSTRACT-FACTORY PATTERN
Programmers all over the world are trying to avoid the idea of adding code to existing classes in order to make them support encapsulating more general information. The Abstract Factory design pattern is used. Using this pattern a framework is defined, which produces objects that follow a general pattern and at runtime this factory is paired with any concrete factory to produce objects that follow the pattern of a certain country. In other words, the Abstract Factory is a super-factory which creates other factories (Factory of factories).

* _Abstract Factory_ offers the interface for creating a family of related objects, without explicitly specifying their classes

**Example**:

In this example, `TextControl` and `ButtonControl` is two different hierarchy that has `TextFactory` and `ButtonFactory` as Factory classes. To Combine these 2 hierarchy to one common Factory. `IControl` interface is created and extended to `TextControl` and `ButtonControl`. Now, we have one common factory called `ControlFactory` that exposes only `IControl` and have access to two factories. Here, client program will not come to know all concrete classes. It only exposed with `IControl` and `ControlFactory`.

### 3.2 BUILDER PATTERN
This pattern allows a client object to construct a complex object by specifying only its type and content, being shielded from the details related to the objects representation. This way the construction process can be used to create different representations. The logic of this process is isolated form the actual steps used in creating the complex object, so the process can be used again to create a different object form the same set of simple objects as the first one.

* Defines an instance for creating an object but letting subclasses decide which class to instantiate
* Refers to the newly created object through a common interface

### 3.3 FACTORY PATTERN
The ultimate idea is not to expose all concrete class to client. Client should only be aware of base class from which all concrete classes were derived. A Simple Factory pattern is one that returns an instance of one of several possible classes, depending on the data provided to it. Usually all of the classes it returns have a common parent class and common methods, but each of them performs a task differently and is optimized for different kinds of data.

* Creates objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client.

**Example**:

In this example, `Hyundai` is an abstract class that extended to several hyundai car models like `Santro`, `Verna`, `I10`, etc. Client program need not come to know all concrete classes available instead it only knows about `HyundaiCars` enum. With the enum, client will come to know details of any cars by knowing only teh abstract class. `HyundaiFactory` will take care of
generating objects based on `HyundaiCars`" enum input.

### 3.4 PROTOTYPE PATTERN
The _Prototype_ design pattern is the one in question. It allows an object to create customized objects without knowing their class or any details of how to create them. Up to this point it sounds a lot like the Factory Method pattern, the difference being the fact that for the Factory the palette of prototypical objects never contains more than one object.

The target classes are constructed by cloning one or more prototype classes and then changing or filling in the details of the cloned class to behave as desired.

* specifying the kind of objects to create using a prototypical instance
* creating new objects by copying this prototype

**Example**:

In this example, I have DNA Samples of more than one person. From which, i have to test Mitochondrial DNA Test and Paternity DNA Test.
DNASample object should not get changed while doing one test. So, object will be cloned and sent for testing so that one testing will
not affect result of another testing. Simply, object will not get changed but deep cloned for multipurpose.

### 3.5 SINGLETON PATTERN
The _Singleton_ assures that there is one and only one instance of a class and provides a global point of access to it. There are any number of cases in programming where you need to make sure that there can be only one instance of a class.

* Ensure that only one instance of a class is created.
* Provide a global point of access to the object.

**Example**:

A typical example is Application Configuration which has `Default` as static property that exposes one object that shared across app domain. `Configuration` class has `Default` static property that exposes single configuration object to entire App-Domain.
